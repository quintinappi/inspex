# MCP Chrome Integration - Diagnostic Report & Fix

## Issue Identified

**Root Cause:** The Chrome MCP extension was NOT installed in Chrome, even though the native messaging host bridge was properly configured and running.

### What Was Working
- ✅ MCP Chrome bridge server running on port 12306 (PID 60940)
- ✅ Native messaging host registered at `/Users/cash/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.chromemcp.nativehost.json`
- ✅ Bridge server responding to HTTP requests
- ✅ Claude Desktop config properly set for streamable-http connection

### What Was Missing
- ❌ Chrome extension NOT installed in browser
- ❌ Extension ID mismatch would prevent communication even if installed

## The Fix

The MCP Chrome system requires TWO components:
1. **Node.js Native Messaging Host** (mcp-chrome-bridge) - INSTALLED ✅
2. **Chrome Extension** - WAS MISSING ❌

### Extension Installation Steps

1. **Extension files downloaded and prepared:**
   - Location: `/Users/cash/chrome-mcp-extension/`
   - Version: 0.0.6
   - Verified Extension ID: `hbdgbgagpkpjffpklnamcljpakneikee`

2. **Install the extension in Chrome:**
   ```
   1. Open Chrome and navigate to: chrome://extensions/
   2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
   3. Click "Load unpacked"
   4. Select directory: /Users/cash/chrome-mcp-extension/
   5. Verify the extension ID matches: hbdgbgagpkpjffpklnamcljpakneikee
   ```

3. **Verify the connection:**
   - The extension should show "Connected" status in its popup
   - The native messaging host is already configured for this exact extension ID

## Why MCP Tools Weren't Available

**Important:** MCP tools are only available in Claude Desktop app sessions, NOT in CLI sessions like this one.

The MCP tools (mcp__chrome_navigate, mcp__chrome_screenshot, etc.) only become available when:
1. Claude Desktop app initializes
2. It reads the config from `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. It successfully connects to the MCP server at startup
4. The Chrome extension is installed and can communicate with the native host

**This CLI session cannot access MCP tools** - they are provided by the desktop app's MCP integration layer.

## Verification Steps

After installing the Chrome extension:

1. **Restart Claude Desktop completely** (quit and reopen)

2. **The MCP Chrome tools should appear:**
   - mcp__chrome_navigate
   - mcp__chrome_screenshot
   - mcp__chrome_get_current_tab
   - mcp__chrome_list_tabs
   - mcp__chrome_click
   - mcp__chrome_type
   - Plus 15+ more browser automation tools

3. **Test basic functionality:**
   ```
   Use mcp__chrome_navigate to go to http://localhost:3001
   Use mcp__chrome_screenshot to capture the page
   Use mcp__chrome_get_current_tab to get current tab info
   ```

## Configuration Files

**Claude Desktop Config:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "streamable-mcp-server": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Native Messaging Host Config:**
```json
{
  "name": "com.chromemcp.nativehost",
  "description": "Node.js Host for Browser Bridge Extension",
  "path": "/Users/cash/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.3/lib/node_modules/mcp-chrome-bridge/dist/run_host.sh",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_origins": [
    "chrome-extension://hbdgbgagpkpjffpklnamcljpakneikee/"
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install the Chrome extension** using the steps above
2. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely
3. **Verify MCP tools appear** in a new session
4. **Test the inspection flow** at http://localhost:3001

## Troubleshooting

If MCP tools still don't appear after installing extension:

1. Check extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
2. Verify extension ID is exactly: hbdgbgagpkpjffpklnamcljpakneikee
3. Check extension shows "Connected" status
4. Restart mcp-chrome-bridge: `pkill -f mcp-chrome-bridge && mcp-chrome-bridge`
5. Check Claude Desktop logs for MCP connection errors
6. Verify port 12306 is not blocked by firewall
