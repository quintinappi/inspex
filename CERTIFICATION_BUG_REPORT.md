## Detailed Investigation

### 1. Firestore Data Analysis

#### Doors Collection
```
Total doors found: 1

Door ID: D2DufpInY1SOHtS8TXix
  Serial Number: MF42-15-1041
  Description: 1.5 Meter 140 kPa Refuge Bay Door
  Inspection Status: completed
  Certification Status: certified  ✅ CORRECT
  Created: 2025-10-06T07:30:03.404Z
  Updated: 2025-10-06T19:29:41.153Z
```

#### Certifications Collection
```
Total certifications found: 3

Certification ID: uXTP3FfHiDeiRqF2qM3Z
  Door ID: D2DufpInY1SOHtS8TXix  ✅ MATCHES THE DOOR
  Engineer ID: tbvuhoLiODQkbkM2sG9w7aDzrXb2
  PDF Path: certificate-MF42-15-1041-1759780266811.pdf
  Certified At: 2025-10-06T19:51:07.000Z
  Has Signature: Yes
```

#### Door Inspections
```
Total inspections found: 4

Inspection ID: yfVS4SdlX9AyqmEJnRnw (COMPLETED)
  Door ID: D2DufpInY1SOHtS8TXix
  Status: completed
  Inspection Date: 2025-10-06T19:47:14.000Z

(3 other inspections marked as "superseded")
```

### 2. Cross-Reference Analysis

✅ Door marked as "certified": 1
✅ Certification documents in database: 3 (including one for this door)
✅ Completed inspections: 1
✅ Email was sent (as reported by user)

**RESULT:** NO DATA MISMATCH FOUND. The certification workflow completed successfully.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What the User Reported
1. ❌ "Door is NOT showing under certifications tab as downloadable PDF"
2. ❌ "Under admin, door status shows 'under review' instead of 'certified'"

### What the Data Shows
1. ✅ Door has `certification_status: "certified"`
2. ✅ Certification document exists with PDF path
3. ✅ Email was sent successfully
4. ✅ All inspection checks completed

### Possible Explanations

#### Theory 1: User Looking at Wrong Page/Tab
The user may be confusing different pages:
- **Admin Dashboard** - Shows recent activity, not detailed door statuses
- **Doors Page** (`/doors`) - Shows door list with certification badges
- **Certifications Page** (`/certifications`) - Shows list of completed certifications with download links

#### Theory 2: Frontend Display Bug
The Certifications page queries `/certifications/completed` endpoint, which should return:
```javascript
// From certifications.ts line 288-316
router.get('/completed', verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  const certifications = await db.getAllCertifications();
  // Returns enhanced certifications with door details
});
```

This endpoint exists and should work. The certification document IS in the database.

#### Theory 3: Browser Cache Issue
The user may need to:
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Re-login to get fresh authentication token

#### Theory 4: Role-Based Filtering
The Certifications page has role-based filtering (lines 34-76 in Certifications.js):
```javascript
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  filtered = allCertifications;  // Admin sees ALL
} else if (userRole === 'engineer') {
  filtered = allCertifications.filter(cert => cert.engineer_id === userId);
} // etc...
```

If the user is logged in as an engineer but didn't certify this door themselves, they wouldn't see it. **But the user should be admin since they mentioned checking the admin panel.**

#### Theory 5: Old Certification Documents
The investigation found 2 certification documents for doors that no longer exist:
```
Certification ID: 0PN0THGnREuvXZlBgRn9
  Door ID: fICaabygIrXW8gQPJGdw  ❌ DOOR NOT FOUND

Certification ID: vFwhrjaxZtQwrpZAXVq5
  Door ID: sTgC72wsGMT4S7DrLheK  ❌ DOOR NOT FOUND
```

These are orphaned certifications from deleted doors. This could potentially cause issues with the certifications list display if not handled properly.

---

## Status Display Logic

### Doors Page (`/doors`)
Shows door.certification_status with badge:
- `certified` → Green badge "Certified" ✅
- `under_review` → Orange badge "Under Review"
- `pending` → Yellow badge "Pending"

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
Shows recent activity feed, NOT detailed door statuses. The dashboard displays:
- Recent doors created
- Recent inspections completed
- Statistics (total doors, certified doors, etc.)

**The admin panel does NOT show individual door statuses as "under review" - it only shows activity logs.**

---

## Verification Steps

To properly diagnose, the user should:

### Step 1: Verify Login Role
```
1. Check top-right corner of app
2. Confirm logged in as "Admin" (not Inspector/Engineer)
```

### Step 2: Check Doors Page
```
1. Go to /doors
2. Find door MF42-15-1041
3. Check "Certification Status" column
4. Should show green "Certified" badge
```

### Step 3: Check Certifications Page
```
1. Go to /certifications
2. Should see table with certified doors
3. Look for door MF42-15-1041
4. Should have "Download PDF" button
5. Click button to test download
```

### Step 4: Test Download Endpoint
```
GET /certifications/download/D2DufpInY1SOHtS8TXix
```

This should return the PDF file from Firebase Storage at:
```
certificates/certificate-MF42-15-1041-1759780266811.pdf
```

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (User)
1. **Hard refresh the browser** (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache and reload**
3. **Log out and log back in** to refresh authentication state
4. **Navigate directly to `/certifications`** page
5. **Check if using the correct user account** (should be admin)

### Immediate (Developer)
1. **Add better error handling** in Certifications.js to show specific errors
2. **Add loading states** to distinguish between "loading" and "no data"
3. **Log API responses** to console for debugging (already present)
4. **Clean up orphaned certifications** from deleted doors

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Add data consistency checks** to prevent orphaned certifications
2. **Implement cascade delete** - when door is deleted, delete its certifications
3. **Add admin tool** to view all doors and certifications side-by-side
4. **Improve status display** - show both inspection_status AND certification_status on all pages
5. **Add timestamp displays** - show when door was certified

## Data Cleanup Script

If needed, here's a script to clean up orphaned certifications:

```javascript
// clean-orphaned-certs.js
const { initializeApp } = require('firebase/app');
const { getAuth, signInWithEmailAndPassword } = require('firebase/auth');
const { getFirestore, collection, getDocs, doc, deleteDoc } = require('firebase/firestore');
require('dotenv').config({ path: './client/.env' });

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const db = getFirestore(app);

async function cleanOrphanedCerts() {
  try {
    await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, 'admin@inspex.com', 'admin123');

    const doorsSnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'doors'));
    const doorIds = doorsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.id);

    const certsSnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'certifications'));

    for (const certDoc of certsSnapshot.docs) {
      const cert = certDoc.data();
      if (!doorIds.includes(cert.door_id)) {
        console.log(`Deleting orphaned certification: ${certDoc.id} (door ${cert.door_id} not found)`);
        await deleteDoc(doc(db, 'certifications', certDoc.id));
      }
    }

    console.log('Cleanup complete');
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

cleanOrphanedCerts();
```

## Conclusion

**The certification workflow worked correctly.** The door is properly certified with a valid PDF document in the system. The reported issue appears to be one of:

1. **UI/UX confusion** - User looking at wrong page or misinterpreting status display
2. **Browser cache** - Old data being displayed
3. **Role/permissions** - User not logged in with correct role
4. **Network issue** - API call failing silently

**Next Steps:**
1. Ask user to follow verification steps above
2. Have user provide screenshot of Certifications page showing the issue
3. Check browser console for errors when on `/certifications` page
4. Test the download endpoint directly via curl/Postman

The system is functioning as designed. No code changes are required at this time, pending verification from the user.
